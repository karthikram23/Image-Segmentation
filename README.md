# Image-Segmentation

The process of partitioning a digital image into multiple image segments is knownas image segmentation. 

The goal of segmentation is to simplify and/or change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze.

Some common applications of image segmentation include medical imaging, video redaction software, and traffic light systems. 

Out of the several methods for image segmentation, this was done using the Random Walker algorithm.
